

As user COLLECTOR with system privileges CATALOG READ, CREATE SCHEMA, and EXPORT

- Open hanacollector_ini.sql and execute it
	--> A schema STAT_COLL with a procedure COLLECT_STATISTICS_FROM_LOAD_TEST and tables
	    LOAD_TESTS, STAT_COLL_EXPLAIN_PLANS, STAT_COLL_LOAD_HISTORY_HOST, STAT_COLL_LOAD_HISTORY_SERVICE,
	    STAT_COLL_SERVICE_THREAD_SAMPLES, and STAT_COLL_SQL_PLAN_STATISTICS was created

- Before each load test
	- open hanacollector_before_load_test.sql
	- change the load test name (here we will keep the name LOAD_TEST_2020_11_11_XX)
	- execute
		--> The two views M_SQL_PLAN_STATISTICS_RESET and M_SQL_PLAN_CACHE_RESET have been reset
		--> An entry have been added in the "STAT_COLL"."LOAD_TESTS" for the new test (here LOAD_TEST_2020_11_11_XX)

- Let's asume load test LOAD_TEST_2020_11_11_XX were being executed between 26.08.2020 08:00 and 26.08.2020 08:30

- After each load test
	- open hanacollector_after_load_test.sql
	- change the load test name, start and stop time, and sap schema, depending on what start/stop time option you choose
	  (here we keep 'LOAD_TEST_2020_11_11_XX', '26.08.2020 08:00:00.000000', '26.08.2020 08:30.00.00000', 'SAPQH1')
	- execute
		--> the collector tables in schema STAT_COLL has been filled with statistics from load test LOAD_TEST_2020_11_11_XX
		    (this can be checked with the commented out select statements)

- When enough load tests have been executed and enough statistics from all those load tests have been collected
	- open hanacollector_export.sql
	- follow the instructions  (maybe in the future we will manage to make this SQL also)
